/**
 * The verifier canary — the drill that gave this package its reason to exist.
 *
 * loop-audit awards its joint-largest signal (14 points) for a verifier, and
 * gates L3 on it, by checking whether a file whose name contains "verifier"
 * exists. An empty file passes. docs/failure-modes.md calls the resulting
 * failure "Verifier Theater" and rates it S2; docs/primitives.md calls
 * maker/checker "the single most important structural pattern for reliable
 * loops". Nothing tested whether the verifier verifies.
 *
 * This runs the real verifier command against real seeded defects in an
 * isolated worktree, and scores it on what it caught:
 *
 *   control  — clean tree      -> the verifier must ACCEPT (exit 0)
 *   mutants  — one seeded bug  -> the verifier must REJECT (non-zero exit)
 *
 * Both directions are required. A verifier that rejects everything catches
 * every mutant while being worthless, and the control run is what exposes it.
