/**
 * loop-drill — fire drills for loop guardrails.
 *
 * docs/failure-modes.md names ten ways loops fail. Some have mechanical
 * counterparts (loop-gate, loop-context's circuit breaker); loop-audit scores
 * whether those counterparts are *present*. Nothing checked whether they
 * actually fire.
 *
 * A drill injects a known fault and asserts the guardrail responds. Every
 * drill carries the failure mode it exercises, so the report reads as coverage
 * of docs/failure-modes.md rather than a list of anonymous assertions.
 *
 * Each guardrail gets both directions, because only one of them is easy:
 *   - sensitivity: the fault is caught (a guardrail that never fires is theater)
 *   - specificity: benign input is NOT caught (a guardrail that blocks
 *     everything passes every sensitivity drill while being useless)
 * A guardrail is only credited when it passes both.
