/**
 * Mutation operators for the verifier canary.
 *
 * The canary needs a defect a competent verifier should reject. Rather than
 * asking a model to invent one (which makes the drill non-deterministic and
 * costs tokens), we borrow mutation testing: apply a small, mechanical,
 * behaviour-changing edit to real source and see whether the verifier notices.
 *
 * Operators are deliberately restricted to edits that change runtime behaviour
 * in every C-family language, and that a reviewer would call a bug rather than
 * a style choice. Anything ambiguous (`<` -> `>`, which breaks TS generics and
 * JSX; `+` -> `-`, which silently mangles string concatenation) is excluded:
 * a false mutant would report a verifier as broken when it was right to
 * approve.
